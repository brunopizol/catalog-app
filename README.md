# My Store React App

This project is a simple e-commerce web application built with React. It allows users to search for products and view them in a grid layout. Additionally, users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-store-react-app.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-store-react-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

### Deployment

See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section in the Create React App documentation for more information.
